# 📲 What is Instafel?

**Instafel** is a community-driven project that delivers the **latest alpha builds of Instagram** with **developer options enabled** — allowing users, developers, and testers to explore Instagram like never before.

These builds are ideal for those who want early access to experimental features, enhanced control, and a peek into the backend behavior of the app.

## 🚀 How Instafel Works

The process behind Instafel is designed to be fast, efficient, and reliable:

1. **Alpha Builds Patched Instantly**  
   Using our in-house patcher, we generate modified Instagram alpha builds with developer options enabled as soon as a new version is released.

2. **Internal Testing**  
   Once a build is generated, it is passed on to our testing team. They ensure that everything works as expected and the build is safe to use.

3. **Automated Release**  
   After successful testing, the **Instafel Bot** automatically uploads the approved build to our official release channel — making it instantly accessible to users.
